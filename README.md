itroduction: I'am a young studen who had a hard time managing the time, soo I decide to make pomodoro timer,
             to help myself in time managment and beside that to practice and learn new skills in programming.
             This application also have user managment so multiple users can use it. My plan was to share this
             app with my friends and other people on internet to empower them to use it and manage their time better.
